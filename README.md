# Truetopia-v2 (t-v2)...

...is an experiment for "public" politics in modern nations (where
most have access to phone and media and nations can reach their
citizens).

## TODOs

1. create project website (multilingual,
   hakyll+s3+disqus+googlegroups+github+etc)
1a. post to hacker news
2. create "demo/beta" bid+vote rounds (yesod+heroku)
2a. post to hacker news
3. get into contact with some government that wants to implement this
3a. post to hacker news
3b. extend the demo to be used at scale
3c. overcome the hurdle of sending all members of group 1 and 2 they
"login"
3d. start running cycles and see how the experiment goes.

No step 4, t-v2 is a three step plan (TM).





      ==============CONTENT==============

The rest is content to be moved over into its pages as soon as i
understand `hakyll` well enough..


It depends on two truths:

* making political decisions cost time and money -- on average our
  government makes 5 decisions at a cost of 2 million $ per day.
* scheduling the "political agenda" for topics our leaders discuss in
  "public" is therefor a crucial process of our government.

For simplicity sake t-v2 acknowledges two types influencers on that
process:

1. the general public a.k.a. the voting citizens of the nation.
   WHO CURRENTLY may influence the "political agenda" by voting once in
   not more then 4 years (`40% did in 2011`), demonstrate (`<5%`) or
   volunteer for a political party (`<1%`), or make a career out of
   politics (`<0.01%`).
2. the organizations as registered by the gov't; can be businesses,
   non-profits, other nations, religious groups, but also individuals,
   WHO CURRENTLY influence the government by either by (a) lobbying "when
   done right" or (b) corruption "when crossing the line". (note: both a
   and b cost organizations money).

T-v2 is not against the CURRENT situation, it merely proposes an
experiment, which can be summarized as:

   "Allocate a small percentage of the political agenda to be scheduled:
      * for 50% by online/sms/phone voting by members of group 1,
      * for 50% by an online public bid open to members of group 2
        (which also includes individuals!).
   Both the votes and the bids are counted in short cycles (compared to
   the current political cycles; so every month rather then every 4
   years)."

The money raised in the bid may be used for a purpose decided by the
government through this system (i.e.: the treasury, donation to charity,
throwing a party, some other cool political experiment that is not cheap
like this one).


## What do you want to learn from this experiment?

"Who to build the online application that drives this experiment" --
Cies Breijs
"What organizations pay for, and how this changes over time" -- Joe
"How the media will cover what is 'trending' this month" -- Jerry
"How beautiful idea will surely make it too the top of the list this
month!! Vote for me here: http://us.t-v2.org/leia888/R9jZtx" -- Leia


Join us in demanding per month a token amount (like 1% or 1 hour for
each group), of agenda time for this experiment! (link to a page listing
the political parties of your nation with the instruction on reaching
them).


## Why this experiment?

* More civil participation is considered healthy for a nation.
* Allowing direct political influence by charing money for it in a bid
  seems like a really bad and scary idea, though the fast growing lobby
industry show we are defacto already there -- why not just experiment
with making it transparent?
